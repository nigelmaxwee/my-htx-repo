# Automated Speech Recognition (ASR)

## Objective
<p align="justify">
To fine-tune an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model using the Common Voice dataset and evaluate its performance against the pre-trained wav2vec2-large-960h model. Additionally, by implementing hotword detection, we aim to identify critical phrases such as "be careful," "destroy," and "stranger," leveraging a text embedding model for similarity analysis. The goal is to develop a customized, high-accuracy ASR system that can effectively recognize domain-specific vocabulary in real-world applications.
